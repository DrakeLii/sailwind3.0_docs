Customizing the SailWind Interface

## **Customizing the SailWind Interface**

You can customize the SailWind interface to suit your work style and design work. You can determine

which toolbars are displayed, add items to toolbars and menus, and create custom toolbars, menus and 

shortcut keys.

To make customizations, use the Customize dialog box. You can invoke the dialog box in two ways:

• From the SailWind interface, click the **Tools > Customize** menu item. All customizations you 

make are applied to the main view of the SailWind tool.

• In a window of the interface (for example, the Output Window), right-click and select **Customize**. 

You customizations apply only to that window.

Your customizations are saved with your current workspace so that all of the changes you make to

toolbars, menus, and shortcut keys are present when you work in that workspace again.

Organizing Windows

## **Organizing Windows**

You can customize the way windows appear in your workspace. Use the available options to show

windows, hide windows, detach a window from the current view, attach a window to the current view,

embed windows within other windows, and manage your windows tabs.

**Showing Windows**

When you first start the application, several windows display. You can show, hide, and automatically hide

any of the windows in the application.

**Procedure**

On the **View** menu, click the name of the window you want to show.

Your choices may include Navigation Window, Output Window, Project Explorer, Help Window,

Spreadsheet, and Shortcut Dialog.

414 

SailWind Logic GuideCustom Interface

Hidden Windows

**Hidden Windows**

When the application opens, several windows are open in addition to your workspace. You can close

some of these windows or hide them automatically to maximize your design space.

Closing Windows

Hiding Windows Automatically

**Closing Windows**

If you do not want a particular window to appear in the workspace, you can hide windows by closing them 

manually.

**Procedure**

\1. Move your pointer to the title bar of the window you want to hide.

\2. Click the small downward pointing arrow on the right side of the window's title bar.

\3. In the resulting menu, click **Hide**.

The window closes.

**Hiding Windows Automatically**

You can also set a window to hide automatically so that it appears when you hover the pointer near it, and

automatically minimizes when you move the pointer away from it.

**Procedure**

\1. Move your pointer to the right side of the title bar in the window you want to hide.

\2. Click the thumbtack in the window's title bar.

The thumbtack picture changes to point sideways . A new bar appears on the side of the 

interface. The side on which the bar appears depends on the location of the window. For example,

if the Project Explorer is located on the left side of the user interface, when you click the Auto Hide 

setting from the menu, the new bar appears on the left side of the interface.

The new bar contains a tab that has the same name as the window.

\3. Hover over the tab in the new bar.

The window reappears, covering the application.

\4. Move the pointer away from the window. The window minimizes to a tab.

**Tip**

To turn off the Auto Hide feature, hover over the tab in the new bar so the window

reappears. Then repeat steps 1-2 in reverse.

SailWind Logic Guide 

415Custom Interface

Detaching Windows From the Current View

**Detaching Windows From the Current View**

You can detach a window from the current view. This is called floating. A floating window is not attached

to the current view; instead, it hovers, blocking the view to anything below it.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

You cannot float a window that is currently set to hide automatically. Turn off the Auto Hide feature before

floating a window.

**Procedure**

Double-click the window's title bar. The window detaches and you can move it to any part of the screen.

**Tip**

To undo the floating, see Attach Windows to the Current View.

416 

SailWind Logic GuideCustom Interface

Attach Windows to the Current View

**Attach Windows to the Current View**

You can attach a window to the current view. This is called docking. A docked window is attached to the

current view, and therefore does not block the view to anything below it. You can dock a window in its last

docked location, or dock a window to a different location.

Docking to the Last Location

Docking to a New Location

**Docking to the Last Location**

If you have moved a window, you can use a title bar keystroke command to dock it to its last docked

location.

**Procedure**

Double-click the window's title bar. The window reattaches to the interface.

**Docking to a New Location**

You can use a drag operation to dock a window to a new location.

**Procedure**

\1. Using the title bar, drag the window.

When you start dragging the window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. At the edges

of the user interface, arrows containing graphics appear, as shown in Figure 7:

**Figure 7. Window Dragging Graphic**

**Tip**

A similar group of arrows appears in a group near the center of the screen. Ignore that 

group of arrows for this procedure.

\2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows on the edge of the user interface. For

example, hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface.

A transparent colored block appears along the side of the user interface to which you are pointing. 

This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse button. For 

example, if you hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface, a block appears along 

the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 8.

SailWind Logic GuideCustom Interface

Embed Windows Within Other Windows

**Embed Windows Within Other Windows**

In addition to attaching a window to a side of the user interface, you can embed a window within another 

window, so that it shares the window space with the original window, or becomes a tab within the original

window.

Two Windows Sharing One Window Space

Creating Tabs Within Windows

**Two Windows Sharing One Window Space**

Use a drag operation to embed a window and share another window's space.

**Procedure**

\1. Using the title bar, drag a window into another window.

When you start dragging a window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. A group of

arrows containing graphics appears in the center of the window you are dragging, as shown in 

Figure 9. Depending on the window you are dragging, the group of arrows may also have a tab 

graphic in the center.

**Figure 9. Dragging a Window—Arrow Group**

**Tip**

A similar group of arrows appears at the sides of the user interface. Ignore those arrows for 

this procedure.

\2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows. For example, hover over the left arrow.

A transparent colored block appears along the side of the window you are dragging, as shown 

in Figure 10. This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse 

button. For example, if you hover over the left arrow, a block appears along the left side of the

windows.

**Rearranging Tabs in a Window**

You can only rearrange tabs that you created by embedding a window within one of the docking windows.

You cannot rearrange regular tabs, such as those in the Output window.

**Procedure**

Drag the tab to a new position within the row of tabs.

**Moving Tabs Between Windows**

You can only move tabs that you have embedded in other windows. In windows that have tabs by default

(such as the Output Window in SailWind Router), you cannot move the tabs. You can only rearrange

them. For information on rearranging tabs, see the previous section.

See also “Embed Windows Within Other Windows” on page 419.

**Procedure**

\1. Drag the tab to a new window.

When you start dragging, the tab automatically behaves like a window.

\2. Place the tab as you would a window.
